# my-projects
Here you'll find some of my projects that I've worked on over the years during and after my schooling.

<h1>Raycasting</h1>
I've made a raycasting engine in Gamemaker studio 2 but due to the way the files are saved in it it's not easy to just drop it in here, or so I believe. So I made this video instead!

I've made some improvements to the engine since that last video. Mostly under the hood with regards to things like resizeability of the window it's running in.

<h1>Raindrops</h1>
A quick sketch I've made several times in Processing 3. I wanted to port it to p5.js to see how it does and learn it.

<h1>Traitor!!!</h1>
An unfinished game I've experimented with for a while now, never fully figured out what it's gonna be to finish it in it's totality.

<h1>calculatorFinal</h1>
A binary tree calculator I made for one of my final projects in college, written mostly in a day and finishing touches put on the next two or so.

<h1>circle_packing</h1>
In an attempt to make more realistic constellations, I experimented with circle packing to make lines drawn to circles that touched others, but not randomly picking the points so they wouldn't end up so close to each other. Left click generates a new screen and right click will toggle showing the circles.

<h1>meszarosMentalHealth</h1>
A website I had to make for a PHP final in college, written in I believe eight hours because that's just what you do in college. Probably shows it too.

<h1>BubbleSort</h1>
A simple algorithm I had to write for an OOP/Data Structures class I had in college.
