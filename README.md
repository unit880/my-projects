# my-projects
Here you'll find some of my projects that I've worked on over the years during and after my schooling.

<h1>Raycasting</h1>
I've made a raycasting engine in Gamemaker studio 2 but due to the way the files are saved in it it's not easy to just drop it in here, or so I believe. So I made this video instead!
